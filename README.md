# AmbitionBox Data Scraping and Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves scraping data from the AmbitionBox website using a parser and preparing it for analysis and visualization using Python.

## Data Scraping
Utilizing a parser, I extracted the following data from AmbitionBox:

- Company Information: Names, industries, and locations.

- Employee Feedback: Ratings and reviews.

- Job Listings: Details on available positions.

- Salary Data: Information on compensation packages.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
After scraping, I performed comprehensive data cleaning and preparation:

1. Removed Duplicates: Ensured each entry was unique.

2. Handled Missing Values: Replaced or imputed missing data where necessary.

3. Standardized Formats: Unified date, currency, and other formats for consistency.

4. Corrected Inconsistencies: Verified company names and locations for accuracy.

5. Data Transformation: Converted categorical data into numerical formats for analysis.

## Data Organization
The cleaned data was structured into a pandas DataFrame for efficient analysis:

- Proper Column Names: Ensured clear and descriptive headers.

- Data Types: Verified appropriate data types for each column.

- Indexing: Indexed the data for quick querying and manipulation.

## Analysis and Visualization Preparation
With the dataset now analysis-ready, I prepared it for various analytical techniques:

- Statistical Analysis: Set up for examining trends in employee ratings and salaries.

- Geographical Analysis: Prepared data for mapping company locations.

- Sentiment Analysis: Organized reviews for sentiment analysis.

- Visualization Subsets: Created subsets for specific chart types, such as time series or bar charts.
